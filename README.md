Also, because you already have a nice box-style workflow, **you don't need Mermaid**. Your current workflow is perfectly fine.

# 🚀 DevPortfolio Agent

> An AI-powered open-source contribution assistant that helps developers discover GitHub opportunities, understand issues, plan contributions, prepare Pull Request drafts, validate their work, and build professional portfolio material.

---

## 📌 Overview

Finding the right open-source project and making a meaningful contribution can be difficult, especially for developers who are new to open source.

Developers often face questions such as:

- Which repositories should I contribute to?
- Which GitHub issues match my skills?
- What exactly does this issue require?
- Which files or components may need to be changed?
- How should I approach the implementation?
- What tests should I perform?
- How do I write a good Pull Request?
- How can I document the contribution in my portfolio?

**DevPortfolio Agent** is designed to help answer these questions through a structured AI workflow.

The agent takes a developer from **finding an opportunity to preparing a contribution and documenting the verified work**.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Many developers want to contribute to open source but struggle with:

- Finding suitable projects
- Understanding unfamiliar repositories
- Selecting appropriate issues
- Understanding contribution requirements
- Planning implementation
- Preparing tests and documentation
- Writing Pull Request descriptions
- Presenting contributions professionally in a portfolio

DevPortfolio Agent aims to reduce this friction by providing a structured contribution workflow.

## 💡 Solution

DevPortfolio Agent combines open-source opportunity discovery, repository and issue analysis, contribution planning, contribution generation, validation, and portfolio generation into one workflow.

## 🏗️ How It Works

DevPortfolio Agent uses a structured AI workflow with web search to discover and analyze open-source opportunities.

The agent prepares contribution material for human review rather than claiming that a contribution has been submitted or merged.

---

## 🎯 Use Case

A developer provides their skills and interests, such as:

**Python · JavaScript · React**

**AI · Automation · Developer Tools**

The agent helps them:

**Find relevant issues → Understand the task → Plan the implementation → Prepare a contribution → Generate portfolio documentation**
